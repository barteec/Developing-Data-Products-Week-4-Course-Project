## Introduction
This peer assessed assignment has two parts.

- First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 

- Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.


Shiny Application can be found [HERE:](https://barteec.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Assign_4_Gapminder_Data/)

Shiny Application source code can be found [HERE:](https://github.com/barteec/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Course-Project) 


## Shiny Application Overview
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. 

- The source code consists of in one file in the Project_shiny folder: [app.R](https://github.com/barteec/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Course-Project/tree/main/Project_shiny)

- The application is hosted on  [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) by RStudio  


## This is how you filter your data
- Label the main titel using a textInput

- Change/determine the size of the plot points using a numericInput

- Add a line of best fit using a checkboxInput

- You can change the color of the plot points using a colourInput

- Select data options using selectInput and sliderInput

- To download filtered data use the download button

## The Graph and Tables
There are two tabs in main panel as below:

- Gapminder Plot: This displays plot for corresponding dataframe

- GapminderTable: This displays a searchable-interactive Table for corresponding dataframe
