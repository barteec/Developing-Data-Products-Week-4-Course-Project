## Introduction

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 
* First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
* Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.



Shiny Application can be found [HERE:](https://barteec.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Assign_4_Gapminder_Data/)

Shiny Application source code can be found [HERE:](https://github.com/barteec/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Course-Project) 


## Application Overview

- The application is written in Shiny which is a web application framework for R
- The source code consists of two files: server.R and ui.R
- server.R includes the the server logic of a Shiny web application
- ui.R includes the the user-interface definition, which uses the sidebarLayout template
- The application is hosted on Rstudio's shiny server in the cloud (Shinyapps.io)

## How it works? - I | The Application contains: Left Panel

- Label the main titel using a textInput
- Change/determine the size of the plot points using a numericInput
- Add a line of best fit using a checkboxInput
- Change/determine the color of the plot points using a colourInput
- Select data options using selectInput and sliderInput
- download filtered data using a downloadButton

## How it works? - II | The Application contains: Main Panel

There are two tabs in main panel as below:

- Plot: This displays plot for corresponding dataframe
- Table: This displays a searchable-interactive Table for corresponding dataframe
